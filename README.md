# Digital Identity and Property Tokenization Platform

Welcome to the Digital Identity and Property Tokenization Platform repository! This project provides a comprehensive solution for registering digital identities and tokenizing properties on the blockchain.

## Overview

This platform allows users to:

1. **Register Digital Identity:** Securely register and store personal information such as ID, name, date of birth, and place of birth on the blockchain. This ensures that your identity is tamper-proof and easily verifiable.

2. **Tokenize Properties:** Convert your real estate properties into digital tokens using the ERC721 standard. These tokens can represent ownership of properties, enabling easier transfer and management of real estate assets on the blockchain.

## Key Features

- **Digital Identity Registration:** 
  - Store important personal data securely on the blockchain.
  - Ensure your digital identity is immutable and verifiable.

- **Property Tokenization:**
  - Mint tokens that represent your property ownership using the ERC721 standard.
  - Securely manage and transfer property ownership through blockchain technology.

- **Seamless Integration:**
  - The platform integrates with Ethereum wallets like MetaMask, allowing for easy interaction with smart contracts.
  - All data interactions are done in a secure and decentralized manner.

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contracts:** Developed using Solidity with OpenZeppelin libraries.
- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum.
- **Frontend:** Built with Next and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend:** Uses `ethers.js` for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Development Tools:** Hardhat and Foundry for testing and deploying smart contracts.
